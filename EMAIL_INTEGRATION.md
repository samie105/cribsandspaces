## 📧 **Email Service Architecture**

### Files Structure:
```
server/
├── config/
│   └── emailConfig.ts          # Nodemailer SMTP setup
├── services/
│   └── emailService.ts         # Email sending functions
└── templates/
    └── emailTemplates.ts       # Beautiful HTML templates
```

### Email Configuration:
- **Provider**: Mailgun SMTP
- **Host**: `smtp.mailgun.org:587`
- **Authentication**: Uses `SMTP_EMAIL` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` from `.env.local`
- **Recipient**: `info@cribsandspacescleaning.co.uk`

---

## 🎨 **Email Template Features**

All email templates include:
- ✅ Professional design with company branding
- ✅ Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Clean typography and spacing
- ✅ Gradient headers with brand colors
- ✅ Well-organized data sections
- ✅ Reply-to functionality (automatically uses customer email)

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### Flow:

1. **User fills out form** → Frontend validation with Zod
2. **Form submits** → Calls server action (e.g., `submitQuoteForm()`)
3. **Server action** → Validates data and calls `sendQuoteEmail()`
4. **Email service** → Generates HTML from template
5. **Nodemailer** → Sends email via Mailgun SMTP
6. **Response** → Success/error message shown to user
7. **Success** → Form resets automatically

---

## 🔐 **Environment Setup**

### Required Environment Variables:

Add these to `.env.local`:

```env
SMTP_EMAIL=postmaster@mg.yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-mailgun-smtp-password
```

### Getting Mailgun Credentials:

1. Sign up at [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)
2. Verify your domain
3. Go to **Domain Settings** → **SMTP Credentials**
4. Copy username and password
5. Add to `.env.local`
